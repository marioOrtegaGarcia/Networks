*****DVRTable can be added to payload through memcpy()*****

NEED TO IMPLEMENT:
*IMPORTANT:    need to add TTL for nodes in neighborlist INSTEAD OF clearNeighbors every Timer.fired()
                    - this is causing a synchronization issues where the routing table doesnt have access to all the neighbors when we print the tables

*Merge Rout isnt merging the tables properly, need to reexamine how that is working. Look at the output and try and see what you can figure out

*Need to call splitHorizon before we send table
