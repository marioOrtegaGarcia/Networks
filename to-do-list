THINGS TO FIX BEFORE PROJECT 3

        * Receiving old packets multiple times (pings and ping replies)
        * Dropping Node 6 makes other nodes dropped
        *


COMMENTS OF ERRORS

        * The second packet we try to send isn't being Recieved which is fine since we are dropping  it, but for some reason every other node stops droppping from the network

read 3.3.2

*****DVRTable can be added to payload through memcpy()*****

NEED TO IMPLEMENT:
*IMPORTANT:    need to add TTL for nodes in neighborlist INSTEAD OF clearNeighbors every Timer.fired()
                    - this is causing a synchronization issues where the routing table doesnt have access to all the neighbors when we print the tables

*Merge Rout isnt merging the tables properly, need to reexamine how that is working. Look at the output and try and see what you can figure out

*Need to call splitHorizon before we send table

* i left comments for you in mergerRoute to point out what needs to be looked at
